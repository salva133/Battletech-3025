# Further Plans without a specific version or branch

## UI
### Main Menu
- disable "New Game"
- add a new Button + Sub Menu "Scenarios" instead
    - Should behave like "Load Game" as it loads a savegame

## Factions
### Mechanics

- Clan Federation "Clans" -> Martial Alliance

## Scenario
### Layout

- recreate scenario with new factions
- new placement of stars
    - peripherial states
    - clans

## Lore Progression
### Static Historical

- Uprising of FRR
- Unification of FedSun and LyrCom to FedCom
    - Royal Wedding Event 
    - Renaming Ruler Title
    - Renaming Ruler to "<Forename> Steiner-Davion
    - Annexation (FedSun annexes LyrCom or vice versa, easier) or Fusion (remove both and give a third new empire all their systems, harder but better)?
- Clan Invasion / Operation Revival
- Destruction of Clan Smoke Jaguar
